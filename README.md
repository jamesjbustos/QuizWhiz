# WEB103 Project 4 - _Custom Quiz Maker - QuizWhiz_

Submitted by: **James Bustos**

About this web app: **The goal of this web app is to allow learners to create customs quizzes and share their quiz so others can test themselves on topics they enjoy. Uses can create a quiz based on a topic of their choice and can define as my questions as they want. If the user wants to modify their quiz afterwards they are free too, and if they want to remove it completely they can do that as well. A prospective feature would be to gamify the process and allow for live quiz submissions and ranking. This app is meant to give learners the ability to create and share their quiz quizzes with other learners.**

Time spent: **72** hours

## Notes

Had a lot of fun with this project, feeling more confident with handling requests and defining useful routes and controllers. Plan to keep working on making my code cleaner and scalable. Apologies if my project was not relevant to the car example, i read the project prompt and thought we could introduce our own ideas. Hopefully i covered all the concepts, Thank you.
